# GraphQL: The Easy Way to Do the Hard Stuff
The GraphQL is rapidly growing in popularity as the new standard for working with APIs, and it's easy to see why! 
Performant and efficient, this groundbreaking API query language gives developers a single API endpoint to access exactly the data they need. 
Relationships and custom resolvers allow you to even further evolve your GraphQL API to access multiple data sources. 
With such extensibility, you can iterate even more quickly on frontend features your application users will love.

This application is the front-end of the BankingDogs application.
